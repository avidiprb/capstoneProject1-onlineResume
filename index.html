    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is pronounced Ah-vee-deep. I am a natural at art. I have been
      artistic since I was a baby. I am also gifted at math. I have a variety of
      experiences that have contributed to my talents. One example is I received
      a high A in PLTW Introduction to Engineering Design class in 9th grade. I
      took this class because I wanted to have a better understanding of how the
      functionality of objects impacts how they look in the 3d-space. At the end
      of this class, I became a certified Autodesk user. I have chosen web
      design as my college major because I can use these gifts here. I also know
      UX Design. My greatest strength is collaborating with others which goes
      with these gifts.
